//authenticate is fundamentally going to serve as a 'local middleware' function
//its a function that lives inside a route and runs in the middle (e.g before you send in a response)
//in this case, before the entire router.post runs, passport.authenticate runs first, to wait for the function to confirm if someone exists/has valid credentials in the e-mail + password room.
//after it finishes authenticating, it'll perform a next() and then move you to the next stage
//this middleware can also handled the req,res callback after it completes its authentication.
//as well, "local" tells authenticate which specific process to use. To give it some perspective, if "local" became "twitter", passport would be communicating with Twitter's database instead.
